# The basic measures

## The basic measures

The study of macroeconomics revolves around a few basic variables (measures):

1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP);

2.  Unemployment rate;

3.  Inflation rate.

. . .

<br>

In addition to their *own* effects in the overall performance of an economy, these 3 variables also share relevant *relationships*, namely:

1.  Okun's law;

2.  Phillips curve.

## Gross Domestic Product

## Gross Domestic Product

<br>

An economy's **Gross Domestic Product** (GDP) is defined as the sum (in money value) of all *final* goods and services produced in an economy in a given period.

. . .

-   The **most important** word in this entire definition is *final*.

<br>

. . .

This implies that *intermediate* goods are excluded from the final calculation of GDP.

. . .

<br>

With the basic definition in mind, the next important distinction is between *nominal* and *real* GDP.

## Gross Domestic Product

<br><br>

| Year | Quantity Produced | Price/unit (\$) | GDP |
|------|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:---:|
| 2019 |        100        |     10,000      |     |
| 2020 |        120        |     12,000      |     |
| 2021 |        110        |     12,500      |     |
| 2022 |        125        |     14,000      |     |

## Gross Domestic Product

<br>

The *key* difference between real and nominal measures (GDP is only one of them) regards taking *prices* into account.

. . .

<br><br>

Given that the real economy has more than one good/service, calculating *real* GDP requires *averaging* the total output a country produces in a given period.

. . .

<br>

The *price* of goods and services are the natural choice for *weighting* this average output.

. . .

<br>

<br>

Understanding GDP in full is not possible without looking at *growth rates*.

<br>

. . .

How to tell whether an economy has grown or not over time?

. . .

<br>

-   The **growth rate** (%) of a variable between two periods is calculated by:

<br>

$$
\text{Growth rate} = \dfrac{\text{Value in the last period} - \text{Value in the initial period}}{\text{Value in the initial period}} \times 100
$$

# The unemployment rate

## The unemployment rate

<br>

While GDP is the most important variable measuring an economy's *size* and *performance*, it **must not** be evaluated in isolation.

. . .

<br>

An individual is considered **unemployed** if they are:

  - not currently employed;
  - actively looking for a job in the previous four weeks.
  
. . . 

<br>

[Official US unemployment data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)


## The unemployment rate

<br>

Furthermore, the **labor force** is the sum of *employed* and *unemployed* individuals:

<br>

$$
\text{Labor force} = \text{Employed} + \text{Unemployed}
$$

. . .

<br>

Thus, the *unemployment rate* (*u*) is the ratio between the number of unemployed individuals (*U*) and the total labor force (*L*):

<br>

$$
u = \dfrac{U}{L}
$$

## The unemployment rate

<br><br>

Those who are not currently employed and *not* actively looking for a job are considered *not in the labor force*.

. . .

<br>

Lastly, the *labor force participation rate* is the ratio between the labor force and the total population of working age.


## The unemployment rate

<br><br><br><br>


*Why* should we care about unemployment?


# The inflation rate

## The inflation rate

<br>

*Inflation* denotes a *sustained* increase in the general price level of an economy.

. . .

<br>

The *inflation rate* is the growth rate of the price level over time.


. . .

<br>

Conversely, if the price level *decreases* over time, the economy experiences a *deflationary* process.

. . .

<br>

Three measures of inflation are worth investigating:

  - The GDP deflator;
  - The Consumer Price Index (CPI);
  - The *Core* CPI.
  

## The inflation rate

<br><br>

The *GDP deflator* is a price index measuring the average prices of *all* final goods and services included in the economy.


. . .

<br>

It is the ratio of Nominal GDP to Real GDP in a given year.

. . .

<br><br>

[Official US data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A191RI1Q225SBEA)


## The inflation rate

<br>

As the GDP deflator includes *all* goods and services produced in a given year, it includes several goods and services that us, final consumers, actually *do not care* about.

. . .

<br>

Thus, the *Consumer Price Index* (CPI) attempts to represent the consumption basket of a typical urban consumer.

. . .

<br>

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the CPI, through the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES).

  - Consumer expenditures are divided into 8 groups, including *food and beverages*, *housing*, *apparel*, *transportation*, *medical care*, *recreation*, *education and communication*, and *other goods and services* (including tobacco, personal services, etc.)


## The inflation rate

<br><br>



[Official US data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)

. . .

<br><br>

The CPI's *Core* Index excludes *food* and *energy* prices, which tend to be the most *volatile* components of the CPI measure.

# Relationships

## Relationships

<br>

Aggregate output, unemployment, and inflation cannot be completely understood without their *interdependence.*

. . .

<br>

Although we will explore some of their relationships in more detail later, it is worth spending a few minutes introducing them right now.

. . .

<br>

First, output and unemployment can be analyzed together through *Okun's law*.

- It states that, if output growth is *high*, unemployment will *decrease.*

. . .

Second, unemployment and inflation are related through the *Phillips curve*.

- When unemployment becomes very *low*, the economy is likely to overheat, and that this will lead to *upward* pressure on inflation.
