# Prologue

## Prologue

<br><br>

After setting up the IS-LM-PC model, we will analyze a few scenarios from a *graphical* perspective:

<br><br>

. . .

- When the economy is *overheating* (actual output is larger than potential output);

- The *zero lower bound*;

- Fiscal *consolidation*;

- *Supply* shocks.


# Short- and medium-run equilibria

## Short- and medium-run equilibria

<br>

Suppose, for simplicity, a *horizontal* *LM* curve.

. . .

<br>

Furthermore, the economy is in an *expansion*, where actual output (*Y*) is larger than potential (natural) output (*Y<sub>n</sub>*).

. . .

<br>

What can the *monetary authority* do to control *inflation* and return the economy back to its "natural" level?

# The zero lower bound


## The zero lower bound

<br>

Now suppose that the economy is in a *recession*.

<br>

. . .

This implies that actual output is *below* its potential level.

. . .

<br>

What can *monetary policy* do?

# Fiscal consolidation

## Fiscal consolidation

<br><br>

We can now assume a situation where the economy is at its "natural" level, and the government wants to *reduce its budget deficit*.

<br><br>

. . .

What will be the effects in an *IS-LM-PC* setting?

# Supply shocks


## Supply shocks

<br><br><br>

Lastly, let us study in detail the effects of *supply shocks* to an economy from this perspective.
