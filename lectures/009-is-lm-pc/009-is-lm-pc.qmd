# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

The IS-LM model provided a comprehensive analysis of equilibrium in *goods* and *financial* markets, as well as the effects of *monetary* and *fiscal* policies to interest rates and aggregate income.

. . .

<br>

Then, moving on to the *labor market* and *inflation* lectures, we were able to study how the *state of unemployment* may affect the *price level*, through the *Phillips curve*.


<br>

. . .

That said, we can move on to a model where these components are put together: the IS-LM-PC model.

. . .

<br>

But first, we need some basic (re-)definitions.

# Inflation

## Inflation

<br>

When the inflation rate is *not* stable over time, how economic agents form their *expectations* becomes a *crucial* factor in wage- and price-setting behavior.

. . .

<br>

Recall:

<br>

$$
\pi_t^e = (1-\theta)\bar{\pi} + \theta \pi_{t-1}
$$

. . .

<br>


- What is expected inflation when $\theta = 0$?

- What is expected inflation when $\theta = 1$?

## Inflation

<br>

In either case, the *natural rate of unemployment (u<sub>n</sub>)* is the unemployment rate such that actual inflation is equal to expected inflation.

<br>

. . .

$$
\pi - \pi_t^e = (m + z) - \alpha u_t
$$

. . .

<br>

$$
0 = (m + z) - \alpha u_t
$$

. . .

<br>

$$
u_n = \dfrac{(m + z)}{\alpha}
$$


## Inflation

<br>

From the previous expression, we can re-write the Phillips curve:

<br>

$$
\pi_t = \pi_t^e + (m+z) - \alpha u_t
$$

. . .

<br>

$$
\pi_t - \pi_t^e = -\alpha \bigg(u_t - \dfrac{(m+z)}{\alpha}\bigg)
$$


## Inflation

<br>

And since $u_n = \dfrac{(m + z)}{\alpha}$,

. . .

<br>

$$
\pi_t - \pi_t^e = -\alpha (u_t - u_n)
$$

. . .

<br>

- The above version of the Phillips curve states that, whenever actual unemployment is *below* its natural level, inflation will be *higher* than expected. 

. . .



- Similarly, if actual unemployment is *at its natural level*, inflation will be *equal* to its expected rate.


# The IS relation

## The IS relation


<br>

When studying the IS-LM model, we defined the equilibrium condition in the goods market as:

$$
Y = Z = C(Y_D) + I(Y, i) + G
$$

. . .

<br>

And now, since we have already incorporated (expected) inflation into our analysis, we may think about interest rates in *real* terms.

. . .

<br>

We can define the *real interest rate*, *r*, as:

$$
r \approx i - \pi^e_{t+1}
$$

## The IS relation


Again:

$$
r \approx i - \pi^e_{t+1}
$$

<br>

. . .

In words, the *real interest rate* is (approximately) equal to the *nominal interest rate minus expected inflation*. 

. . .



A few implications:

- When expected inflation equals *zero*, the nominal and the real interest rates are *equal*;
- Because expected inflation is typically *positive*, the real interest rate is typically *lower* than the nominal interest rate;
- For a given nominal interest rate, the *higher* the expected rate of inflation, the *lower* the real interest rate.


## The IS relation

<br>

That said, we may re-write the equilibrium condition in the goods market as:

<br>

$$
Y = Z = C(Y_D) + I(Y, r) + G
$$

<br>

$$
Y = Z = C(Y_D) + I(Y, i - \pi^e_{t+1}) + G
$$

# The PC curve

## The PC curve

<br>

The IS-LM model took place in a *(Y, i)* two-dimensional space.

<br>

. . .

If we wish to incorporate the Phillips curve into the analysis, at least one of the axes must match with the IS-LM model's.

. . .

<br>

Therefore, let us try to express the Phillips curve in terms of *inflation* (*&pi;*) and *output* (*Y*).


## The PC curve

<br>


First, by definition, the unemployment rate (*u*) is equal to unemployment (*U*) divided by the labor force (*L*):

$$
u \equiv \dfrac{U}{L} = \dfrac{(L - N)}{L} = 1 - \dfrac{N}{L}
$$

<br>

where *N* is the number of employed individuals.

<br>

. . .

Solving for *N*:

$$
N = L(1 - u)
$$

## The PC curve

<br>

Still assuming an aggregate production function $Y = A \cdot N$, with $A = 1$, we may write:

<br>

$$
Y = N = L(1 - u)
$$

. . .

<br>

And if we consider the *natural rate of unemployment*, *u<sub>n</sub>*, we may write an expression for the *natural level of output* (i.e., *potential output*), *Y<sub>n</sub>*:

$$
Y_n = N = L(1 - u_n)
$$


## The PC curve

<br>

We are now able to write an expression for the *output gap*:

<br>

$$
Y - Y_n = -L(u - u_n)
$$

. . .

<br>

Using our latest Phillips curve (and dropping time indexes):

$$
\pi - \pi^e = -\alpha (u - u_n)
$$

. . .

<br>


$$
\pi - \pi^e = \bigg(\dfrac{\alpha}{L}\bigg) (Y - Y_n)
$$

## The PC curve

<br>

And if expectations are well-anchored, expected inflation will be equal to the target set by the monetary authority (e.g., 2% in the United States):

<br>

$$
\pi - \bar{\pi} = \bigg(\dfrac{\alpha}{L}\bigg) (Y - Y_n)
$$

. . .

<br>

And here we have an equation relating *inflation* and *output*.
