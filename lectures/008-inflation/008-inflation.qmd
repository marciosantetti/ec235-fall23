# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

After studying the labor market and how it influences wage- and price-setting behavior, it is time to connect (un)employment and *inflation*.

. . .

<br>

Whenever the price level rises in a *consistent* and *generalized* way, we may say that an *inflationary* process is taking place.

. . .

<br><br>

And one of the ways in which we can study this phenomenon is through what happens in the *labor market*.


# Inflation and unemployment


## Inflation and unemployment

<br>

Recall the *wage-setting* relation:

<br>

$$
W = P^e \cdot F(u,z)
$$

. . .

<br>

So far, we have not explicitly assumed a form to the function *F*.

. . . 

<br>

Let us start by a *linear* form:

<br>

$$
F(u,z) = 1 - \alpha u + z
$$


## Inflation and unemployment

<br>

$$
F(u,z) = 1 - \alpha u + z
$$

<br>

where *&alpha;* captures the *strength* of the effect of unemployment on wages.

. . .

<br>

Then, the price-setting relation becomes:

<br>

$$
W = P^e (1 - \alpha u + z)
$$


## Inflation and unemployment

<br>

And recall the *price-setting* relation:

<br>

$$
P = (1+m)W
$$

. . .

<br>

Using the wage- and price-setting equations together:

<br>

$$
P = P^e(1+m)(1 - \alpha u + z)
$$

. . .

<br>

... And this expression gives us a relation between the *price level*, the *expected price level*, and the *unemployment rate*.

## Inflation and unemployment

<br>

In case we want to replace the price level by the *inflation rate*, *&pi;*, and the *expected* inflation rate, *&pi;<sup>e</sup>*, we end up with

<br>

. . .

$$
\pi = \pi^e + (m+z) - \alpha u
$$

<br>

. . .

What are the effects of:

:::{.incremental}
- A rise in the markup rate, *m*?

- An increase in expected inflation, *&pi;<sup>e</sup>*?

- A decrease in the unemployment rate, *u*?

# The Phillips curve

## The Phillips curve

<br><br>

For a better understanding of what is to come, it will be convenient to include *time indexes* in our previous inflation equation:

<br>

$$
\pi_t = \pi_t^e + (m+z) - \alpha u_t
$$


. . .

<br><br>

where the subscript *t* refers to the *present* period; *t-1* to the previous period, and so on.

## The Phillips curve

<br>

In 1958, A. W. Phillips (1914--1975) empirically found that low rates of unemployment were associated with high rates of inflation, and high unemployment with low inflation.

. . .

This relationship has since been referred to as the *Phillips curve*.

## The Phillips curve

<br>

From the Phillips curve equation:

<br>

$$
\pi_t = \pi_t^e + (m+z) - \alpha u_t
$$

. . .

<br>

Assume, first, a *stable* scenario, with no persistent change in the price level.

. . .

<br>

This can be represented by *&pi;<sup>e</sup> = 0*.

. . .

<br>

Then, it becomes

$$
\pi_t = (m+z) - \alpha u_t
$$

```

## The Phillips curve

<br>


Why did the original Phillips curve change?

. . .

<br>


We need to bring back *&pi;<sup>e</sup>*.


. . .

<br><br>

Now,

$$
\pi_t^e = (1-\theta)\bar{\pi} + \theta \pi_{t-1}
$$


## The Phillips curve

<br>

When *&theta;* = 1, we have:

<br>

$$
\Delta \pi_t = (m + z) - \alpha u_t
$$

<br>

where *&Delta;&pi;<sub>t</sub> = &pi;<sub>t</sub> - &pi;<sub>t-1</sub>* is the *change in the inflation rate*.

. . .

<br>



*High* unemployment leads to *decreasing* inflation; *low* unemployment leads to *increasing* inflation.

. . .

<br>

This version is known as the *accelerationist* Phillips curve.

# The "natural" rate of unemployment


## The "natural" rate of unemployment

<br>

When we studied the labor market, we defined the *natural* *rate of unemployment* as the unemployment rate at which the actual price level (*P*) is equal to the expected price level (*P<sup>e</sup>*).

. . .

<br>

Applying back this idea with our Phillips curve equation, we have *&pi; = &pi;<sup>e</sup>*:

<br>

$$
0 = (m+z) - \alpha u
$$





## The "natural" rate of unemployment

<br>

and the *natural* *rate of unemployment* (*u<sub>n</sub>*) is given by

<br>

$$
u_n = \dfrac{(m+z)}{\alpha}
$$

. . .

<br>

What does this relation imply for *unemployment* and *inflation*?
