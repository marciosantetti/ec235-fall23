# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

The previous two chapters introduced the *goods* and *financial* markets, respectively.

. . .

<br>

In the first, we explored the determinants of *aggregate demand* (*Z*), and how equilibrium can be reached when production (*Y*) is met by *aggregate expenditures*.

. . .

<br>


In the second, we saw that the *interest rate* plays a key role in the demand for and supply of *money*, and how equilibrium may be reached through *monetary policy*.


. . .

<br>

However, just looking at these two markets on their own is *not* sufficient to fully understand the macroeconomy.

## Prologue

<br><br><br><br>

Now we turn to the *IS-LM* model, which combines the *goods* and *money* markets for a more comprehensive macroeconomic analysis.

# The IS relation

## The IS relation

<br>

Recall *aggregate demand* in a *closed* economy:

<br>

$$
Z = C + \bar{I} + G
$$

. . .

<br>

And we assumed that *C* is a function of disposable income (*Y<sub>D</sub>*), and *I* and *G* were *exogenously* determined.

<br>

. . .

Moving on, we will *abandon* the assumption that aggregate investment (*I*) is given.

## The IS relation

<br>

Aggregate investment is in fact *far from constant* and depends primarily on two factors:

<br>



:::{.incremental}
1. The level of *sales*;

2. The *interest rate*.

:::

. . .

<br>

First, firms facing increases in *sales* will need to *invest* further in order to increase production.

. . .

<br>

Second, firms almost *never* have the entirety of funds to finance themselves to make such investments. Thus, they need to *borrow* from the money market.

## The IS relation

<br><br>

Given this motivation, we may write the *investment function* as:

<br>

$$
I = I(Y, i) \hspace{1cm} \dfrac{\partial I}{\partial Y} > 0 \ \ ;  \ \ \dfrac{\partial I}{\partial i} < 0
$$

<br>

. . .

In words, an increase in output (*Y*) *increases* investment; and an increase in the interest rate (*i*) *decreases* investment.


## The IS relation

<br><br>

Now we can rewrite the aggregate demand function *Z* as:

<br>

$$
Z = C(Y_D) + I(Y,i) + G
$$

. . .

<br>

And we know that equilibrium in the goods market (*Y = Z*) also implies that *investment equals savings*:

<br>

$$
I = S
$$

## The IS relation

<br><br>

The name *IS* comes from *Investment-Saving*.

. . .

<br><br>

Thus, let us use this last equilibrium condition to derive the IS curve.

. . .

<br><br>

Intuitively, we would like to find *all combinations* of the interest rate (*i*) and output (*Y*) that bring *equilibrium* to the goods market.



## The IS relation

<br><br>


What factors will affect the *slope* of the the IS curve?

. . .

<br><br><br>

What factors will *shift* the IS curve?


# The LM relation

## The LM relation


<br>

Now, we turn to the *financial* market.

. . .

<br>

We all know that the demand for money (*M<sup>D</sup>*) depends on income (*Y*) and on the interest rate (*i*):

<br>

$$
M^D = PY \cdot L(i)
$$

<br>

. . .

And equilibrium in the money market is reached when the supply of money (*M<sup>S</sup>*) is met by money demand:



$$
M^D = M^S
$$

## The LM relation


<br>

The name *LM* comes from *Liquidity-Money*.

<br><br>

Thus, let us use this last equilibrium condition to derive the LM curve.

. . .

<br><br>

Intuitively, we would like to find *all combinations* of the interest rate (*i*) and output (*Y*) that bring *equilibrium* to the money market.

## The LM relation


<br><br>


What factors will affect the *slope* of the the LM curve?

. . .

<br><br><br>

What factors will *shift* the LM curve?

## The IS-LM model

<br><br>

The *upward-sloping* LM schedule shows the points of equilibrium for the *money* market.

. . .

<br>

The *downward- sloping* IS schedule shows the points of equilibrium for the *goods* market.

. . .

<br>

The point of *intersection* between the two schedules is the (only) point of general equilibrium for the two markets.

Let us now explore this further with an *example.*
