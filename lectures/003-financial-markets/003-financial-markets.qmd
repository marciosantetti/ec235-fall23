# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

By studying the goods market, we have covered the *real* side of the economy. 

. . .

<br>

However, only looking at the real side is *not sufficient* for a complete understanding of the macroeconomy.

. . .

<br>

For instance, if households want to *save* money, it is likely that they will need a *bank* account where they may put their money.

. . .

<br>

Furthermore, firms rarely purchase new machinery using their own funds. They usually need some *financing.*

. . .

<br>

Thus, the *financial* side of the economy is just as important as the real.

# The demand for money

## The demand for money

<br>

First, a bit of *semantics*:

<br>

:::{.incremental}

- *Money* ($) is the medium we use to pay for transactions.
  - By *money*, we mean *currency* and *checkable deposits*.
  

  
- *Income* is what people earn from working (wages and salaries), as well as any other *flow* such as *interest* and *dividends.*



- *Wealth* is a *stock* variable, the value of one's financial *assets* minus financial *liabilities.*



- Finally, *saving* is the portion of disposable income one *does not* spend.

## The demand for money

<br>

Given someone's *wealth*, they may decide to keep saving money *or* to further *increase* this wealth.

. . .

<br>

Then, they face a choice between the *two* most important financial *assets*:

  - *Money*;
  - *Bonds.*
  
. . .

<br>

The *fundamental difference* between money and bonds has to do with *two* points:


  - Bonds *pay interest*; money does not;
  
  - No one can *pay for transactions* using bonds, only with money.
  



## The demand for money

<br>

So how can one balance *bond* ownership and *money* holding?


. . .

<br>

This boils down to *two* factors:

<br>

:::{.incremental}

  - One's *level of transactions*;
  
  - The *interest rate* on bonds.

:::

## The demand for money

<br>



Given this *dilemma*, we may *model* this situation mathematically.


. . .

<br>

The *demand for money* (*M<sup>d</sup>*) in the whole economy is the sum of all individual demands for money by households and firms, and can be represented by:

<br>

$$
M^d = PY \cdot L(i) \hspace{2cm} \dfrac{\partial M^d}{\partial{PY}}>0 \ ; \ \dfrac{\partial M^d}{\partial{i}}>0
$$

. . .

<br>

where *PY* is *nominal* income and *L(i)* is a *liquidity* function.

## The demand for money

<br>



## The demand for money

<br><br><br>

While the demand for money increases *in proportion* to increases in nominal income (*Y*), people will hold less money in *liquid form* the higher the *interest rate* (*i*).








# The interest rate

## The interest rate

<br>

The equation $M^d = PY \cdot L(i)$ summarizes the *demand for money*.

. . .

<br>

But the analysis is not complete without the *supply of money*.

. . .

<br>

We will for now assume that the economy's *central bank* supplies an amount *M* of money to the entire economy:

<br>

$$
M^s = M
$$

. . .

<br>

where the *s* superscript denotes *supply*.

## The interest rate

<br>


As we once again have *supply* and *demand* equations, we can reach an *equilibrium* relation:

$$
M^s = M^d
$$

. . .

$$
M^s = PY \cdot L(i)
$$


. . .

<br>

The variable responsible for bringing the *equilibrium* between money demand and money supply is the *interest rate* (*i*).

## The interest rate

<br>

Using the previous figure as a reference, what happens when:

<br>

:::{.incremental}
- The central bank increases the money supply (*M<sup>s</sup>*)?

<br>

- There is an increase in nominal income (*PY*)?

:::



# Monetary policy




## Monetary policy


<br>


To model money supply, we assumed that the *central bank* decides on a quantity of money to be made available in the economy, denoted by *M<sup>s</sup>*.

. . .

<br>

However, this process is more complicated in real life than just a decision made by a "central bank entity."

<br>

. . .

Central banks change the supply of money in an economy by either *buying* or *selling* in bonds in financial markets.

<br>

. . .

These actions are called *open market operations* (*OMO*).


## Monetary policy


<br>

If the central bank wants to *decrease* the amount of money in the economy, it *sells* bonds and *removes* liquid money from circulation, as it receives in money exchange for the bonds.

<br>

. . .

If it wants to *increase* the amount of money in the economy, it *buys* bonds and pays for them by *creating* money. 



. . .

Whenever either of these actions take place, the central bank is engaging in *monetary policy*.


:::{.incremental}

- A monetary policy is labeled *expansionary* when it *expands* the supply of money (*M<sup>s</sup>*) by *buying* bonds from the public.

- A monetary policy is labeled *contractionary* when it *decreases* the supply of money (*M<sup>s</sup>*) by *selling* bonds to the public.

:::


## Monetary policy


<br><br><br>

Let us investigate these two situations *graphically.*



## Monetary policy


<br>

Since the supply of money is changed through *bond markets*, let us investigate these further.

. . .

<br>

How are bond *prices* related to the *interest rate* in the economy?

. . .

<br>

If one buys a bond today and it promises to pay, say $100 in a year, the *rate of return* (i.e., the *interest rate*) on this bond is given by

$$
i = \dfrac{\$100 - P_B}{P_B}
$$

. . .

where *P<sub>B</sup>* is the price of the bond.

## Monetary policy


<br>

Given the previous formula, what is the interest rate (*i*) when:

. . .

<br>

- The price of the bond (*P<sub>B</sup>*) is $95?

- The price of the bond (*P<sub>B</sup>*) is $110?

- The price of the bond (*P<sub>B</sup>*) is $150?

. . .

<br>

Can we derive a *relationship* between bond *prices* and the *interest rate*?


## Monetary policy


<br>

Now we can fully understand how Open Market Operations work.

. . .

<br>

Suppose the central bank engages in an *expansionary* operation, *buying* bonds in the bond market and paying for them by *creating money*.

. . .

<br>

As the central bank buys bonds, the demand for bonds *goes up*, *increasing* their price. 

. . .

<br>

Conversely, the interest rate on bonds goes *down.*

. . .

<br>

This way, the central bank has *increased* the money supply.


## Monetary policy


<br><br>

This way, *monetary policy* affects *interest rates*. 

. . .

<br><br>

By buying or selling bonds in exchange for money, the central bank affects the price of bonds, and by implication, the interest rate on bonds.



# Adding financial intermediaries


## Adding financial intermediaries


<br>

In the *real world*, money includes not only currency but also *checkable deposits*.

. . .

<br>

And checkable deposits are supplied not by the central bank but by *(private) banks*.

. . .

<br>

Modern economies are characterized by the existence of many types of *financial intermediaries*---institutions that receive funds from people and firms and use these funds to *buy* financial assets or to make *loans* to other people and firms.
