# The composition of GDP

<br>

After reviewing some of the most important macroeconomic variables---*output*, *(un)employment*, and *inflation*---, it is time to start diving into the actual *name* of this course:

. . .

-   *Macroeconomic Theory*!

. . .

<br>

And we will start this process by looking at the *composition* of aggregate output (GDP).

. . .

<br>

Never forget:

$$
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - IM)
$$



## The composition of GDP

<br>

Again:

$$
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - IM)
$$

. . .

where:

::: {.incremental}

- *C*: aggregate consumption; 
- *I*: aggregate investment; 
- *G*: government expenditures; 
- *X*: exports; 
- *IM*: imports.


:::

## The composition of GDP

<br>

Important remarks:


::: {.incremental}

- *Investment* (*I*) in the macro sense is NOT the same as purchasing financial assets!

- *I* also includes *changes in inventories*;

- *Government spending* (*G*) does NOT include transfer payments (e.g., Medicare and Social Security);

- The difference between exports and imports (*X - IM*) is also known as the *trade balance*.

## The demand for goods

<br>


Defining the *whole* economy's **demand for goods and services** (goods, for short) as *Z*, we can write the following *identity*:

$$
Z \equiv C + I + G + (X - IM)
$$

. . .

<br>

For simplicity's sake, our analysis will start off by assuming a *closed* economy (i.e., a country that does not do business with the rest of the world):

. . .

<br>

$$
Z \equiv C + I + G 
$$

. . .

<br>

Now, we can start *modeling* the (macro)economy.


## The demand for goods

<br> 

Now, we can start *modeling* the (macro)economy.

. . .


But what *perspective* are we adopting to model the macroeconomy?


. . .

## The demand for goods

<br>

Starting off with *aggregate consumption* (*C*), it is a positive function of *disposable income* (*Y<sub>D</sub>*):

$$
C = C(Y_D) 
$$

. . .

where

$$
\hspace{1cm} \dfrac{\partial{C}}{\partial{Y_D}} > 0
$$

. . .

<br>

Here, *C(Y<sub>D</sub>)* denotes a *behavioral equation* representing the *aggregate consumption function* of this economy.


## The demand for goods

<br>


The *simplest* way to define the *functional form* of the consumption function is through a *linear* representation like

$$
C = c_0 + c_1Y_D
$$

. . .

<br>

In words:

::: {.incremental}
- Aggregate consumption is a *linear function* of disposable income;

- *c<sub>0</sub>* represents *autonomous* consumption (i.e., independent of income);

- *c<sub>1</sub>* is the economy's (marginal) *propensity to consume*.

  - What does *c<sub>1</sub>* represent?

<br>

![](c.png){fig-align="center" width="650" height="500"}


## The demand for goods

<br>

Since *Y<sub>D</sub> = Y - T*, we can *rewrite* the consumption function as

$$
C = c_0 + c_1\underbrace{(Y - T)}_{\text{disposable income}}
$$

. . .

<br>

What are the effects of:

  - Aggregate income (*Y*) on consumption?
  
  - Taxes (*T*) on consumption?
  
## The demand for goods

<br>

Moving on to aggregate investment, *I*, we will assume (for the time being) that it is given *exogenously*:

<br>

$$
I = \bar{I}
$$

. . .

<br><br>

We will *relax* this assumption later on.


## The demand for goods

<br><br>


Finally, government spending (*G*) denotes one component of *fiscal policy*.

. . .

<br><br>

The other are Net Taxes (*T*).

. . .

<br><br>

We will also assume that public spending and taxes are *exogenous.*


## The demand for goods

<br>

Now we are ready to write a more *detailed* equation for aggregate demand:

<br><br>

$$
Z \equiv c_0 + c_1(Y - T) + \bar{I} + G
$$


# Equilibrium output

## Equilibrium output

<br>


*Equilibrium* in the goods market requires that production *Y* be equal to the demand for goods *Z*:

$$
Y = Z
$$

. . .

<br><br>

Let us explore this scenario in three ways:

  1. Algebraically;
  2. Graphically;
  3. Verbally.



# Investment = Saving


## Investment = Saving

<br>

An *alternative* way of looking at the equality between production and demand is to focus on *investment* (*I*) and *saving* (*S*).

. . .

<br>

*Private saving* (*S*) (i.e., consumers' saving) is the remainder of their disposable income after consumption:

$$
S \equiv Y_D - C
$$

. . .

<br>

Or, equivalently,

$$
S \equiv Y - T - C
$$

. . .

## Investment = Saving

<br>

The previous identity concerns the *private sector*.

<br>

We can include the *public sector* by recalling *aggregate output* (*Y*):

$$
Y = C + I + G
$$

<br>

. . .

Subtract *taxes* (*T*) and *consumption* (*C*) on both sides:

<br>

$$
Y - C - T = I + G - T
$$

## Investment = Saving

<br>


$$
\underbrace{Y - C - T}_S = I + G - T
$$

<br>

. . .

$$
S = I + G - T  
$$


<br>

. . .

$$
I = S + (T - G)
$$

<br>

. . .

The left-hand side is the *sum* of *private* and *public saving*.


## Investment = Saving

<br>

$$
I = S + (T - G)
$$

<br>

This relation states that *equilibrium* in the goods market requires that aggregate investment equals saving---the sum of private and public saving.

. . .

<br>

In other words, *what firms want to invest must be equal to what people and the government want to save.*


## Investment = Saving

<br>

Starting from:

$$
S_p = Y - T - C
$$

. . .

<br>

Using the definition of aggregate consumption (*C*), find an expression for aggregate saving (*S*) containing autonomous consumption (*c<sub>0</sub>*) and the *marginal propensity to save* (*1 - c<sub>1</sub>*).
