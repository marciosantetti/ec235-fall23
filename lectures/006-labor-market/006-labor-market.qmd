# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

So far, our analysis of macroeconomic equilibrium have *ignored* what happens to *wages, employment*, and *prices.*

. . .

<br>

Recall that, for instance, our IS-LM model may generate higher *output* (*Y*) in a variety of ways.

<br>

. . .

But, in order to produce more goods and services, *more people* must be *employed*, and this affects the level of *wages* and *income distribution* in the economy.

. . .

<br>

Thus, now we add the *labor market* into our study of the macroeconomy.

# Wage- and price-setting

## Wage- and price-setting

<br>

We can start *modeling* wage determination through the following equation:

<br>

$$
W = P^e \cdot F(u,z)
$$

<br>

where:

:::{.incremental}
- *W*: aggregate *nominal* wage;

- *P<sup>e</sup>*: *expected* price level;

- *u*: the *unemployment rate*;

- *z*: a variable catching *all other factors* that may determine wages.

## Wage- and price-setting

<br><br><br>

Why should workers bother about the *(expected) price level* when negotiating wages?





## Wage- and price-setting

<br>

Now, let us focus on *prices*.

. . .

<br>

As a first *simplifying assumption*, we will assume that expectations regarding the price level as as *accurate* as possible, so *P<sup>e</sup> = P*.

. . .

<br>

Then, we have:

<br>

$$
W = P \cdot F(u,z)
$$

$$
\dfrac{W}{P} = F(u,z)
$$


## Wage- and price-setting

<br>

Then, *firms* *set* the price for their product based on the *costs* they face.

. . . 

For the time being, we will assume a simple production function with only one factor of production (i.e., only one input):

<br>

$$
Y = A \cdot N
$$

<br>

where 

:::{.incremental}
- *Y*: output;

- *A*: labor productivity;

- *N*: number of workers (employment).

## Wage- and price-setting

<br>

Furthermore, we will consider a scenario of *imperfect competition*.

. . .

<br>

This means that firms can set a *markup rate (m)* on their final price:

. . .

<br>

$$
P = (1 + m)W
$$

<br>

. . .

And we can get to:


$$
\dfrac{W}{P} = \dfrac{1}{(1+m)}
$$

## Wage- and price-setting

<br><br>

Again:

$$
\dfrac{W}{P} = \dfrac{1}{(1+m)}
$$

. . .

<br><br>

What is the relation between the *real wage* and the *markup rate*?



# Equilibrium


## Equilibrium


<br>

*Equilibrium* in the labor market requires that the real wage chosen in *wage setting* be equal to the real wage implied by *price setting*.

. . .

<br>

In mathematical terms:

$$
F(u_n,z) = \dfrac{1}{(1+m)}
$$


. . .

<br>

where *u<sub>n</sub>* is the *"natural" rate of unemployment*.

## Equilibrium


<br><br><br>

The equilibrium rate of unemployment (*u<sub>n</sub>*) is then a function of institutional factors *z* and of the markup rate *m*.

## Equilibrium


<br><br>


Consider the following:

<br><br>


:::{.incremental}
- What happens to the labor market equilibrium when, for instance, *unemployment benefits* increase?


- A weaker enforcement of existing *antitrust* legislation?
