# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

Last time, we derived two relations involving aggregate output per worker (*Y/N*) and an economy's capital stock per worker (*K/N*):

<br>

<br>

1. $\dfrac{Y}{N} = F\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}, 1\bigg) = f\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}\bigg)$

. . .

<br>

2. $\dfrac{K_{t+1}}{N} - \dfrac{K_t}{N} = s\dfrac{Y_t}{N} - \delta\dfrac{K_t}{N}$


## Prologue

<br>

$$
\dfrac{Y}{N} = F\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}, 1\bigg) = f\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}\bigg)
$$

<br>

The first relation defines the *long-run aggregate production function* only depending on the economy's *capital intensity* (or *capital per worker*).

## Prologue

<br>

$$
\dfrac{K_{t+1}}{N} - \dfrac{K_t}{N} = s\dfrac{Y_t}{N} - \delta\dfrac{K_t}{N}
$$

<br>

The second relation gives the *law of motion of capital*: capital per worker depends on two factors:

. . .

<br>

1. Investment per worker: since *I = sY<sub>t</sub>* and given the saving rate *s*, output per worker determines the amount of *saving* per worker and thus the *investment* per worker;

. . .



2. Depreciation per worker: the capital stock per worker determines the amount of *depreciation* per worker.

# Capital and output dynamics

## Capital and output dynamics

<br>

Given the two relations, we can further understand the dynamics of capital and output over time.

. . .

<br><br>

The *easiest* way to do so is through a graph.

## Capital and output dynamics

<br>

The state in which output per worker and capital per worker are no longer changing is called the *steady state* of the economy.

. . .

<br>

In mathematical terms, the steady state is reached when there is no change in the capital stock per worker:

$$
\dfrac{K_{t+1}}{N} - \dfrac{K_t}{N} = s\dfrac{Y_t}{N} - \delta\dfrac{K_t}{N} \implies 0 = s\dfrac{Y_t}{N} - \delta\dfrac{K_t}{N}
$$

. . .

<br>

$$
s\dfrac{Y^*_t}{N} = \delta\dfrac{K^*_t}{N}
$$

## Capital and output dynamics

<br>

As $\dfrac{Y}{N} =  f\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}\bigg)$, we can write the steady state as:

<br>

$$
sf\bigg(\dfrac{K^*}{N}\bigg) = \delta\dfrac{K^*}{N}
$$

# Sources of growth


## Sources of growth

<br>

Now that we are aware that there exists a possible *steady state* of economic growth, what are the *sources* of economic growth over the long-run?

<br>

A few candidates:

1. The capital intensity;

2. The savings propensity *s*;

3. Consumption ("golden rule");

4. Technological progress.


. . .

<br>

Let us think about each of them.
