# Prologue

## Prologue

<br>

So far, our lectures focued on the *short-* and *medium-run* features of the macroeconomy.

. . .

<br>

In both time frames, economic *fluctuations* dominate the picture.

. . .

<br>

However, when looking at the behavior of aggregate *output*/*income* over time, fluctuations become less apparent and *economic growth* dominates.

. . .

<br>

Thus, we now turn our attention to the *long-run*, with the purpose of understanding *what determines economic growth*.

# Thinking about growth

## Thinking about growth

<br>


The *conventional* approach to economic growth is due to the work of [Robert M. Solow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Solow).


. . .

<br>

The starting point of such approach is through an *aggregate production function*:

<br>

$$
Y = F(K, N)
$$

. . .


where *Y* is aggregate output; *K* is the capital stock; and *N*, the number of employed workers.

. . .

<br>

What are some of the *limitations* of such modeling approach?

## Thinking about growth

<br>

Given an aggregate production function, *how much* output (*Y*) can be produced for given quantities of the capital and labor inputs, *K* and *N*, respectively?

. . .

<br>

The answer lies on *technology*.

. . .

<br>

  - Countries with more advanced technology will produce more output from the same quantities of *K* and *N* than will an economy with less advanced production methods.
  
## Thinking about growth

<br>

Now, time to think about some *restrictions* we may impose on the aggregate production function.

. . .

<br>

The first is thinking about what happens to *F(K, N)* when we, for instance, *double* both the number of workers and the amount of capital in the economy.

. . .

<br>

We'll assume *constant returns to scale* (CRS):



$$
F(2K, 2N) = 2Y
$$

. . .

More generally:

$$
F(xK, xN) = xY
$$

## Thinking about growth

<br>

What if we assume that *only* *one* factor of production increases?

. . .

<br>

Even under constant returns to scale, there are *decreasing returns to each factor*.

. . .

<br>

There are *decreasing returns to capital*:

  - Given labor, increases in capital lead to *smaller and smaller increases* in output. 
  
. . .


  
There are *decreasing returns to labor*:

  - Given capital, increases in labor lead to *smaller and smaller increases* in output.


## Thinking about growth

<br><br>

From the aggregate production function, we can specify it in terms of the labor input, *N*:

<br>

$$
\dfrac{Y}{N} = F(\dfrac{K}{N}, \dfrac{N}{N}) = F(\dfrac{K}{N}, 1)
$$

## Thinking about growth

<br>

Two key things from the previous charts:

<br>

. . .

1. Capital accumulation *by itself* cannot sustain growth;

<br>

2. *Sustained* growth requires *sustained technological progress*. 


# Interactions between output and capital


## Interactions between output and capital

<br>


The determination of output over the long-run depends on two relations between output (*Y*) and capital (*K*):

. . .

<br>

  - The amount of capital determines the amount of output being produced;
  
  - The amount of output being produced determines the amount of saving and, in
turn, the amount of capital being accumulated over time.


. . .

<br>

From the aggregate production function normalized by labor, we may *simplify* things by writing:

$$
\dfrac{Y}{N} = F\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}, 1\bigg) = f\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}\bigg)
$$

## Interactions between output and capital

<br>


Again:

$$
\dfrac{Y}{N} = F\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}, 1\bigg) = f\bigg(\dfrac{K}{N}\bigg)
$$

. . .

<br>

This relation implies that we assume employment *N* to be *constant* over the *long-run*.

. . .

<br>

This way, we are able to *focus* on the process of *capital accumulation* over time and its *effects* on growth.

## Interactions between output and capital

<br><br>

If we introduce *time indexes*, we may write:

<br><br>

$$
\dfrac{Y_t}{N} = f\bigg(\dfrac{K_t}{N}\bigg)
$$



## Interactions between output and capital

<br>

Next, we move on to how output and capital accumulation are related over time.

. . .

<br>

We will keep assuming a closed economy, with *investment* being equal as the sum of *private* and *public* savings in equilibrium:

$$
I = S + (T-G)
$$

. . .

<br>

For simplicity, we will assume a balanced budget (i.e., public savings are equal to zero), so investment equals private savings:

$$
I = S
$$

## Interactions between output and capital

<br>

Private savings are *proportional* to aggregate income:



$$
S = sY
$$



. . .

where the parameter *s* is the *saving rate* ($0 < s < 1$).

. . .

<br><br>

Combining what we have so far, we can write:

$$
I_t = sY_t
$$

. . .

<br>

The above relation states that investment is *proportional* to aggregate income/output.


## Interactions between output and capital

<br>

Turning to the capital stock, *K*, we will assume that it depreciates at a rate *&delta;* per year.

. . .

<br>

Equivalently, a proportion *(1 - &delta;)* remains intact from one year to the next.

. . .

<br>

The evolution of the capital stock is then given by:

<br>


$$
K_{t+1} = (1 - \delta)K_t + I_t
$$


## Interactions between output and capital

<br>

Normalizing the previous relation by the number of employed workers, *N*:

<br>

$$
\dfrac{K_{t+1}}{N} = (1 - \delta)\dfrac{K_t}{N} + \dfrac{I_t}{N}
$$

<br>

. . .

Rearranging...

<br>

$$
\dfrac{K_{t+1}}{N} - \dfrac{K_t}{N} = s\dfrac{Y_t}{N} - \delta\dfrac{K_t}{N}
$$

## Interactions between output and capital

<br>


Again:

<br>

$$
\dfrac{K_{t+1}}{N} - \dfrac{K_t}{N} = s\dfrac{Y_t}{N} - \delta\dfrac{K_t}{N}
$$

. . .

<br><br>

This relation implies that the *change in the capital stock per worker*, represented by the *difference* between the two terms on the *left*, is equal to *savings per worker*, represented by the first term on the right, minus *depreciation*, represented by the second term on the right.
