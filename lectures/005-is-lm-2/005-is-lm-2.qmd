# Prologue

## Prologue

<br><br><br>

After setting up the *IS* and *LM* schedules and their *interaction*, we move on to analyzing the effects of *economic policy* on the *goods* and *money* markets.


# Monetary influences

## Monetary influences

<br>

We begin by looking at the *money market*.

. . .

<br>

More specifically, how does *monetary policy* affect the level of *output* (income) and the *interest rate*?


. . .

<br><br>

Let us consider an increase in the *money supply (M<sup>S</sup>)*.



# Real influences

## Real influences


<br>

Now, let us look at the *goods market*.


. . .

<br>

More specifically, how does *fiscal policy* affect the level of *output* (income) and the *interest rate*?

. . .

<br><br>

<br>

1. An increase in *Government expenditures* (*&Delta;G > 0*);

2. An increase in *Net Taxes* (*&Delta;T > 0*).

# Policy effectiveness


## Policy effectiveness


<br>

How *effective* can fiscal and monetary policies be?

. . .

<br>

In other words, what will be the *size* of the effects on *income* (*Y*) and on the interest rate (*i*) of a given change in the policy variable?

. . .

<br><br>

In short, the effectiveness of each policy will depend on the *slopes* of the *IS* and *LM* schedules.
