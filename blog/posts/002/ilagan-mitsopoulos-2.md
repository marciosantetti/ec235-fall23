# Greece’s economic recovery



*By Evangelos Mitsopoulos & Diego Ilagan*



As of October 21st, 2023, The Standard and Poor Global changed Greece’s credit rating to investment grade after a decade of bailouts from bankruptcy. In February 2012, S&P decided that Greece’s investment grade would be Selective Default, referring to the lowest investment grade that a country could have. S&P Global is a publicly traded corporation based in the United States that focuses on market research on countries around the world and bases the S&P 500 index on the information that they have gathered. Thus, for Greece to go from the lowest grade to a BBB- would signal “the greatest turnaround in the European financial system” according to Fokion Karavias, chief executive of Eurobank. 

This turnaround can be attributed to many key factors including the improvement of the unemployment rate which has been decreasing. 12.16% in 2022 and is now projected to end with 11.8%. Moreover, Greece’s GDP has also increased by 8.4% in 2021 and a further 5.9% in 2022. S&P also noted the recovery of the Greek economy from COVID-19 being substantially better than other countries in the region. 

The official increase in the investment grade of Greece serves as an announcement for investors that Greece is a great frontier for investments. A high investment grade can attract investors to open new businesses, and for companies to employ more jobs, to keep the momentum for positive economic growth. Furthermore, this allows Greece to cooperate with international financial markets to partner with organizations and institutions for access to more opportunities. It signifies that after more than a decade of dealing with the effects of the Great Recession, the positive work has been recognized by the international community. Overall, economists at Goldman Sachs believe that Greece will be able to outperform this year and next year as well.

Greece might be having positive GDP growth that leads to the investment grade increasing to BBB- on paper might seem like a positive change. However, there are still economic barriers preventing the return of the pre-2009 economy. Currently, wages are at the lowest they have been since the recession, Greek people are shouldering the highest costs of electricity in Europe, unemployment remains high, and inflation remains relevant. Thus, according to Giorgos Chouliarakis, the economic adviser to the Greek Central Bank states that Greece might need another decade or more to be able to at least become the same as it was in 2009.
