# **Even the Strong may Fall: A drawback in Germany’s Economic Growth**



*By Vu Duc Minh and Brendan Thein*



Germany, for the past century, has been the bastion of economic success, due to its great export of high-end luxury goods like cars and industrial machinery. Ever since 2009, the “black zero,” or *schwarze Null* has been a requirement and pride for the German economy as while the rest of the world was drowning in fiscal debt; for Germans, jobs were plentiful, government debt was almost non-existent, and books were written about Germany’s mythical economy. However, as of currently, it is no longer the economic powerhouse of the EU.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently released their snapshot on Germany, where they projected that Germany’s economy was on track to shrink by 0.2% this year, down from an estimate for zero growth made in June. Additionally, they also associate Germany with the sharpest downgrade among EU countries, forecasting a growth of 0.9%, down from a previous estimate of 1.3%. High inflation is reducing real incomes and savings by 5.4%, while dampening private consumption.

The reason was due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in the halting of Moscow’s cheap natural gas industry, thereby heavily damaging Germany’s industrially-advanced but energy-intensive economy, 1⁄3 of which was dependent on Russian energy supplies. Christian Kullmann, CEO of major German chemical company Evonik Industries AG, commented that Germany risks “deindustrialization” as high energy costs and government inaction on other chronic problems threaten to send new factories and high-paying jobs elsewhere. Additionally, China, whose economic boom is beginning to end after a 40-year streak- according to Ling Ling Wei and Stella Xifan Yi’s report- is experiencing a major economic slowdown to a growth rate of 4.6%. Hence, Germany’s once long-standing trade partner is not importing and exporting as much as before. Clare Lombardelli, the OECD chief economist, said:“Germany, perhaps more than other EU economies, is affected by the slowdown in China. It exports a lot to China, as well as imports, so it’s a combination of factors.

It is impossible to escape the thoughts that these exogenous shocks to Germany’s economic status have revealed the drawbacks of a once praised economy and fiscal policy. Perhaps, Germany grew complacent during a “golden decade” of economic growth in 2010-2020 based on reforms under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in 2003-2005 that lowered labor costs and increased competitiveness, says Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.
