# Understanding the Consumer Price Index and Inflation’s Political Impact



*By Charlotte Mahn & Randy Moreta*



Recently, there has been some debate concerning the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and how it measures inflation. Inflation may be measured in different ways in order to fit the context. The CPI is mainly used to measure the day-to-day inflation rate in a consumer’s expenses (fixed basket of goods). A measurement like the GDP Deflator does a greater job measuring expenses in both consumers and government/institutions.

The CPI we know of represents 93% of urban consumers in the United states and their spending habits. This excludes those from institutions and nonmetropolitan areas. However, there is a version of the CPI called CPI-W which measures CPI for only urban wage workers and clerical workers with the additional requirements being: a wage/clerical position should take up more than half of a household’s income and one of the income earners should have been employed for at least 37 weeks. An item usually enters the CPI’s basket of goods if it accounts for the majority of sales in its particular category. For example, if a brand of milk accounts for 70% of sales in the milk category, it is more likely it will be chosen in the basket.

Last week Paul Krugman, an American economist who writes for The New York Times, tweeted that according to the CPI, “inflation had been largely defeated.” Following his post on twitter, many people responded with backlash saying it was an inaccurate representation of inflation in the United States. In his article, he proceeded to explain that the CPI excludes the prices of things like food and energy “because they fluctuate in ways that can lead to policy mistakes.” Policy cannot revolve around these very fluid items because their prices do not accurately measure the state of the economy. Just last week, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that gasoline prices in the month of August accounted for over half of the rise in overall inflation.

Some people see Krugman’s statement as minimizing the experiences of working class people who are affected by inflation to a greater degree. The inflation rate falling does not mean prices are falling; they are just rising at a slower rate. Understanding the CPI is important for understanding inflation, and Mr. Krugman’s tweet shows just how little people actually understand the measures used to summarize the economy.
