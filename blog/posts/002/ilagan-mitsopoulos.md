# **Recent Rise in the Philippines’ Declining Inflation Rate Due to Rice**



*By Diego Ilagan and Evangelos Mitsopoulos*



The Philippines has been struggling with inflation at a peak of 8.7% in January 2023. Since then, there has been a slow disinflation noting lowering rates until July at 4.7%, the lowest in the last 16 months. However, there was an uptick in inflation again rising by 0.8% in August 2023 to 5.5%. This rise was not sudden, and the experts pointed their fingers at rice.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the Philippines consists mostly of food and non-alcoholic beverages at 39%, housing and utilities at 22%, transportation at 8%, and others. National Statistician Dennis Mapa stated that the 30% increase in the price of vegetables and related commodities especially rice and tomatoes was a large contributing factor in last month’s inflation rate. Moreover, the Philippines culturally has rice as a staple for most meals causing it to be a large part of daily consumption despite income. 

The reason the price of rice, and other vegetables are rising, is mainly due to severe weather conditions in the Philippines affecting production. Furthermore, trade restrictions with other countries like India and Myanmar affect the market price. India is the largest rice exporter in the world, while the Philippines is the largest rice importer. Upon the announcement that the Indian government would ban rice exports, the prices began to rise worldwide in response to an incoming rice shortage.

Domestically, according to the Secretary of the Philippine National Economic and Development Authority, “the alleged hoarding incidents, artificial shortage and speculative business decisions of market players may have put further upward pressure on the domestic retail price of rice.”

The Philippine government had already discussed the rising price of rice, implementing Executive Order 34 - a price ceiling on the price of both domestically milled rice and imported rice. The policy was to protect the consumers while also curbing imported inflation. The price cap on rice ranged from 41php to 44php, 20% lower than the higher market price of 55php. This cap has been implemented for the last 2 weeks but is already in discussion to be removed once harvest season arrives in the Philippines.
