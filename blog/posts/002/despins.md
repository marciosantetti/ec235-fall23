# How China’s Real Estate Issues Hurts the Entire Economy



*By Marah Frese-Despins*



The Chinese economy, the second largest in the world, is facing severe issues. Many of these issues can be linked to the crippling real estate market. The real estate market and its related businesses make up roughly twenty-five percent of China's GDP and for the past few years has been at the forefront of the country's large growth rates. The property market was soaring to heights not seen previously. Unfortunately, this growth has come to a halt as many developers including two of China's largest privately owned developers, Evergrande, and Country Garden, are debt laden. 

Evergrande faced issues a few years ago because it used borrowed money to make promises to home-buyers that it failed to keep. Many of these homebuyers are sitting in limbo waiting for their homes that may never be finished. On Evergrande’s side, it is struggling to get the cash it needs as most of its money is tied up in escrow until it closes these homes. Evergrande can no longer pay its debts and has narrowly escaped bankruptcy by branching out into other sectors and selling shares. 

More recently, another one of China's largest privately owned developers, Country Garden, struggled to complete its payments as a result of Evergrande’s issues. Consumers and investors alike lost confidence in the housing market after Evergrande's struggles and stopped giving money to Country Garden. This caused China's investment to decrease. Additionally, many city governments were harmed because much of their income came from selling land to these large property developers.

To combat this fall in confidence and investment, China eased up on some of its down payment requirements to make it easier for first and second-time home buyers to purchase homes. Additionally, the Chinese government also promised to buy yuan-denominated bonds in order to help some developers raise cash to pay off debts.

Despite these efforts by the government, the economy is still struggling. Prices in China have fallen for the first time in almost two years. This not only harms the Chinese economy but also the global economy. With less confidence and fewer savings, many Chinese families are spending less. This results in issues around the globe as many businesses make money from China's spending. It also means that there is less demand for goods such as oil and machinery. Without a shift in consumer spending and investment, China faces serious problems.
