# How Does Interest Impact Credit?



*By Regan Laing & Ben Shortsleeve*



Credit card issuing companies may add onto the federal funds rate (interest rate) when they advertise annual percentage rates for cards. In other words, the interest rate of a credit card holder can vary depending on what bank or credit card issuer they hold. However, they cannot freely tamper with the interest rates of the card holder. 

A credit card company is authorized to increase the cardholder’s interest rate on rare occasions, such as being two months late on payments, significant credit score decreases or the increase of the federal funds rate. Luckily, consumers are protected by the Card Act which forces credit card companies to give the card holders 45 days to accept or reject the interest rate change. If it is rejected, the consumer can close their account if they pay off their balance without any penalties. Naturally, the increase of credit interest rates is unappealing to many consumers, but the companies use the money accumulated by the interest to function. 

The Congressional Budget office, predicts our continuous increase in the federal budget deficit, and was correct about their predictions for this fiscal year (2023), so far. Debt held by the public, loans, credit cards, homes, and more, will increase continually predicted through 2033; In quarter two of this year at over 24 trillion, the CBO predicts debt held by the public will double in twenty years.

Consumers are still cautious to make payments on some of their higher interest debt, as it seems we won’t see adjustments back down to where we were this time last year. Surpassing the trillion dollar mark in credit card debt was a good sign that the rate of consumers who were defaulting on loans wasn’t decreasing anytime soon. Prior to the 2020 pandemic the delinquency rate on credit card loans was similar to last quarter at 2.77%, but still was only rising slightly since 2014. This issue some consumers fear is that with a possible rising rate of default on these loans, will the credit card companies increase current and new rates, reasonably and proportionally? Will we again see rates of delinquency similar to pre 2008, or during 2009? Not anytime in the near future, hopefully. Most credit cards are covered by the credit card act, which can possibly help consumer debt relief in the short term. What about the long term?
