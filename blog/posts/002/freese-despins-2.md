# The Implications of the UAW Strike on the Auto Market



*By Marah Frese-Despins*



On September 15th, over 150,000 auto workers at Detroit's big three automotive makers went on strike. The workers from Ford, GM, and Stellantis demanded a 40% wage increase, with 20% of that being given immediately. In addition, they demanded better benefits and assurance for the future. Though these demands are fair, they are hard for the big three to enact quickly. The difficult-to-meet demands meant that this strike went on for almost 40 days. It cost automakers over 7 billion dollars and had effects on more businesses than just the big three.

Many small businesses felt the effects of this strike as did much larger companies. With so many auto factories shut down, parts supplier had nowhere to sell their products and were also forced to shut down temporarily. Mechanics could no longer do business as usual because they couldn't get the pieces they needed to repair certain cars. For the parts they could get, it took 2-3 weeks longer than usual which made business less effective and temporarily decreased profits. Though GM, Ford, and Stellantis can take this hit, small local businesses can't absorb it as easily and some were forced to shut down.

Part of the reason that the big three could take the hit was because of the shift in consumer behavior. Consumers, with expectations set for future price hikes, purchased cars sooner rather than later. This led to an increase in car sales that helped keep the Big Three functioning throughout the strike. Additionally, more consumers turned to used cars meaning the depreciation rate of cars has decreased at least for the time being. Moreover, because we are seeing an increase in consumer price expectations, we will likely see an increase in real inflation as well.

Lastly, this strike has affected workers in many different practices. For one, truckers, with no parts to deliver, are being laid off. Workers from the supplier companies are also being hit with temporary layoffs as less labor is required to meet the Big Threes' lower demand for parts. With more workers laid off, consumption decreases because they are more cautious of the future. Had the big three waited any longer to meet the high demands of the UAW, we would've undoubtedly seen an increase in prices not just of cars but of all products.
