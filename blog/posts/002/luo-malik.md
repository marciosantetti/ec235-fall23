*By Shijie Luo & Charles Malik*



In the third quarter of 2023, U.S. real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 4.9%, up from 2.1% in the second quarter. However, more complete data will be released on November 29, 2023.

Consumption was the main driver of economic growth, with significant growth in both goods and services spending. Within the services sector, housing and utilities, health care, financial services and insurance, and food services and accommodations were major contributors. On the goods side, mainly prescription drugs and recreational goods, and vehicles were the main contributors. Retail sales rose by 3.8% year-on-year in September, reflecting the dynamism of the consumer and indicating strong consumer appetite.

In addition, private inventory investment, exports, and federal and state/local government spending contributed positively to GDP. Of these, federal government spending and residential fixed investment increased, raising GDP. However, these positive factors were partially offset by a decline in nonresidential fixed investment and an increase in imports, which are treated as a deduction in the calculation of GDP.

Current dollar GDP grew at an annual rate of 8.5%, or $560.5 billion, reaching $27.62 trillion in the third quarter. This indicates the buoyancy of economic activity and is significantly better than the 3.8 percent increase in the second quarter.

In addition, the index for gross domestic purchases increased by 3.0%, and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 2.9%. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased by 2.4%, compared with a 3.7% increase in the previous quarter.

On personal income, personal income increased by $199.5 billion in the third quarter, albeit less than the $239.6 billion increase in the second quarter. Disposable personal income increased by $95.8 billion or 1.9%, compared with an increase of $296.5 billion or 6.1% in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, real disposable personal income fell by 1.0%. The personal savings rate also declined to 3.8% from 5.2% in the second quarter, suggesting a possible shift in consumers' saving and spending behavior.
