# Warring Oil – Energy prices within ongoing conflicts in the Middle East



*By Brendan Thein & Minh Vu*



The recent outbreak of military warfare in the Middle East, specifically the Israel-Hamas conflict has resulted in an increase in global energy price. When the war broke out after the attacks on October 7th, Israel shut down its gas production at its Tamar gas field. This resulted in decreasing gas flows to neighboring countries such as Egypt, which usually exports half its gas supply to Europe via seaborne tankers (Ambrose). Additionally, trade between European economies and their lower regions has been put to a halt in addition to diminishing consumer confidence.

The accumulation of said events have spiked concerns of implications for Europe’s economic growth and inflation in the eurozone. The concern being based on fears of the conflict spilling over and engulfing the Middle East – which geographically neighbors Europe. Realistically however, it is unlikely that reduced trade will have a significant impact on Europe's GDP as the EU area exports around 0.4% of its goods to Israel and its neighbors (Ambrose). On the contrary, a significant point of concern is the impacts on Europe’s economy from the war-affected oil and gas markets. 

Since the conflict broke out, the price of crude oil and natural gas has had an increase in price from 9% at lowest to 34% at highest. According to economics analyst Katya Vashkinskaya “a persistent 10% oil price increase usually reduces the EU area’s real GDP by about 0.2% and consumer prices by 0.3% after a year” (Smith). Although the figures are shown to be small, a continued increase in prices may potentially spiral out of control and result in inflation as consumer and business confidence may fall from uncertainty. 

Although only the commodities market is affected by the Israel-Hamas conflict, resources such as crude oil and natural gas serve as the main source of fuel for transportation and energy production. An increase in oil prices would result in a potential shock to aggregate supply as production may fall and prices rise. Additionally low consumer confidence as a result of the war would lead to a decrease in aggregate spending which correlates to a reduction in real output and potentially, increased unemployment.

Overall, it is too early to make bold assumptions of a future recession. However, if the war were to spread and engulf the Middle East, oil prices would significantly rise and the EU’s trade partners may be obstructed resulting in stagflation among European economies.
