# Job Growth Slows in October and the Threat of Recession Becomes Real



*By Charlotte Mahn & Randy Moreta*



The effects of the pandemic on the economy have been lingering for the past few years; however, these effects are becoming more stable with time. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, in October, the economy received an inefficient stimulus of 150,000 jobs while the employment rate increased to 3.9% from 3.8%. However, the three-month average of job creation was 204,000, which is treated as a good sign although still seen as underwhelming by economists. 

Of these jobs, 96,000 workers went unemployed due to strikes. In the *Journal of Policy Modeling*, Pedro S. Martins says that “monthly transitions from employment to unemployment increase by 10% as soon as the eligibility condition is met”. People are more likely to go on strike and argue for higher wages or quit their jobs if they satisfy the criteria for unemployment benefits. However, as wages increase, so does inflation; people of low-income households and small businesses are hit the hardest due to increase in inflation and interest rates.

In the article from *The New York Times*, Smith mentions that “the signs of recent cooling reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve would hold off on further interest rate increases in its fight against stubborn inflation. Bond prices rose, and stocks delivered a fifth straight day of gains.” The cooling he is referring to is the slowing of job growth. As more people gain employment, inflation begins to rise at faster and faster rates; an economic principle demonstrated in the Phillips Curve. The Federal Reserve then does what they can to cool the economy, usually overheated by the increase in transactions that comes when more people are employed. These actions by the Fed include selling treasury bonds and increasing the interest rate, thus encouraging consumers to decrease their liquid money. Smith also notes that “Fed policymakers have been encouraged by recent decelerations in wage growth.” Lower wages discourage the higher employment levels that lead to the increase in price levels; a detriment to employees but a benefit to consumers–a strange paradox that exists because of the Phillips Curve. 

The economy exists in a cycle of booms and recessions, and though a recession seems to loom with the new employment figures in the month of October, a former economist for the Fed said it would “take a longer-term rise in unemployment to signal an approaching recession.”
