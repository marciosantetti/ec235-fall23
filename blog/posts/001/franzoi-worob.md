# What is the title?

One reoccurring headline in the U.S. media cycle for the past year and a half has been concerns over inflation and its effect on the average American’s purchasing power. Inflation is not a new phenomenon in the United States, but the extent to which we have experienced inflation during the start of the 2020s has been staggering. Using data from the *Bureau of Labor Statistics,* we can see percentage change in Consumer Price Index (an index of important goods for consumers) during the previous decade annual percentage changes never exceeded 3%, whereas in 2021 and 2022 there was a 7% and 6.5% increase, respectively. It has been a focus of the Federal Reserve (FED) to get these rates back down to normal levels.

 

A recent New York Times article written by Jeanna Smialek claimed that the long-awaited trek back to a reasonable inflation rate must be prolonged as Americans' spending power decreases in 2023. Inflation has fluctuated, climbing from 3.3% in July to a current 4.2%. The FED’s job to fight inflation was never expected to be smooth nor easy, and they see this inflation rise as another bump in the road. Although the current inflation rate is 2% higher than in their models, The FED predicts inflation to slow in the latter half of 2023 and into 2024.

 

Now to talk a little bit more about how inflation is measured within the economy; the FED’s method of calculating inflation is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. This index measures the change in price for basic goods and services for average Americans. Everything from groceries, electronics, and vehicles are included in the PCE index. There is also another measure called the Core PCE price index which leaves out two of the most volatile categories, Food and Energy. 

 

Why should you care about this macroeconomic issue? Inflation at its core is a measurement of purchasing power and paints a picture of how much your money is worth. Inflation is important to understanding how, and to what extent, the price of basic goods and services are changing. Without an understanding of the current inflation, your salary and wages have no context in the economy. They are just numbers on a screen.
