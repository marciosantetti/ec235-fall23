# Turkey Combatting High Inflation



*By Aditya Agarwal and Siyabonga Mabuza*



Turkey’s central bank anticipates that inflation would reach an alarming 58% under the direction of its new governor, Hafize Gaye Erkan. In comparison to the 22.3% prediction issued just three months earlier, this expectation is much higher.

With inflation rising as high as 85%, Turkey has been struggling with excessive inflation for some time. With a rise of 3.9% from one month to the next, yearly inflation in June was 38.2%. With a predicted annual increase of more than 60% in food prices. Inflation is now expected to be 33% by the end of 2024 and 15% by the end of 2025, according to the central bank's updated projections.

Turkey’s central bank increased interest rates from 17.5% to 25% at the end of August. This was done as an attempt to control the inflation issues which the country has been facing in recent years. This increase in interest rates has resulted in the benchmark interest rate being at its highest since 2004.

The central bank went on to release a statement, saying that they had increased the interest rates to “establish the disinflation course as soon as possible, to anchor inflation expectations, and to control the deterioration in pricing behaviour.” The result of this monetary tightening was that the Turkish lira briefly rose to more than 7% against the U.S Dollar, meaning that it was trading at 25.6 per dollar in Turkey.

Despite Turkey’s annual inflation rate having decreased in the past year to 48% (from about 80% last year), the lira has lost 80% of its value against the dollar since 2018. This has drastically increased the cost-of-living for the people in Turkey. In July consumer prices increased by 47.8% compared with the same month in 2022.

Turkey has also increased taxes on many goods and services, the most notable being a 200% boost in petrol taxes. These tax increases are imposed to diminish demand and increase government tax revenue.
