# The Market Thinks the Fed is Going to Start Cutting Rates Aggressively



*By Christian Giresi & Calder Appel*



Recent positive economic data has ignited speculation about the Federal Reserve's potential aggressive stance on interest rates in the coming year. Eased consumer and wholesale inflation rates have triggered market enthusiasm, with traders eyeing a significant percentage-point cut by the end of 2024. However, caution prevails among experts, who emphasize that while progress is evident, the case for rate cuts isn't conclusive.

The Federal Reserve's destination is clear – not just a 2% annual inflation rate, but convincing progress toward that goal. After speaking after the September meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the need for clear evidence before making policy adjustments. Traders, however, seem more confident than Fed officials, as reflected in futures pricing indicating potential rate cuts in the coming months.

Relating expected rates to current rates, reporter Jeff Cox noted: "futures pricing Wednesday indicated no chance of additional hikes this cycle and the first quarter percentage point cut coming in May... that would take the benchmark rate down to a target range of 4.25%-4.5% and would be twice as aggressive as the pace Fed officials penciled in back in September." This will result in markets heavily anticipating the next policy meeting on December 12th and 13th. However, there are two more inflation reports and an employment report in the meantime that may influence the Fed’s short term policy action.

This recent market enthusiasm is based on the idea that the Fed will accomplish its goal of a “soft landing” (the process of shifting from growth to slow growth in an attempt to slow inflation) .The Fed is adamant not to repeat its previous mistakes and instead fight inflation even if the economy shows signs of slowing down (as it already has). Despite recent trends suggesting the possibility of economic downturn in the near future, there is a belief that the most likely outcome will be a slower economy rather than a recession. According to Former Boston Fed President, Eric Rosengren, this is as good of an outcome as the Fed could expect. The economy looks to be growing (but not too fast), with a falling inflation rate and unemployment at 4%.
