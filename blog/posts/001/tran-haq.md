# Why did Fitch Downgrade the United States’s Credit Rating?



*By An Tran & Kam Haq*



Fitch and S&P Global, two of the three major credit rating agencies, have downgraded the long-term U.S credit rating from “AAA” to “AA+” for the first time since 2011. This implies that their bonds were deemed riskier, which can cause investors and buyers to demand a higher return to purchase these bonds. Fitch’s downgrade decision is a result of “repeated debt limit standoffs and last-minute resolutions”, this increase in risk is caused by the government debt crisis and the increased interest rate.

Congress is in charge of establishing the maximum limit on the U.S Treasury’s outstanding debt. The U.S. government requested Congress to suspend the debt limit to avoid defaulting on a debt of $33.17 trillion. The passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2022 helped suspend the debt limit until January 2025. Fitch’s downgrade is based on rising government deficits expected at 6.3% of GPD in 2023 compared to 3.7% in 2022. The agency forecasts that the government deficits in 2024 of 6.6% of GDP, along with a moderate increase to 6.9% of GDP in 2025 will generate wider growing deficits that lead to increase in interest burden.

Looking at the United States’ GDP growth, the post-pandemic expansionary boom has slowed down. Fitch predicts a slight recession from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, expecting the current growth rate of 1.2% to fall to 0.5% in 2024. Fitch’s predictions are based on recent monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates by 5.25% to 5.75% to lower inflation to around 2%. This has resulted in weaker investment and consumption, due to tighter credit conditions. Tight credit conditions result in higher interest costs, preventing the government from fulfilling their debt obligations, which could spell trouble for investors. As interest rises, the cost of government borrowing increases, linking to the government deficits problem.

Despite concerns about the United States’ macroeconomic and debt situation for investors, it is unlikely that much will come of Fitch’s downgrade. As Luke Teily, an economist for Wilmington Trust, notes “banks and investors are unlikely to step back abruptly from their reliance on Treasurys as a safe-haven benchmark following the actions of a single rating agency” However, if nothing is done to address the ability of the United States to pay off debt, investors and banks may just do that.
