# Potential for Soaring Oil Prices Amid Escalation of the Israel-Palestine Conflict



*By Derrick Trinh*



Multiple articles highlight concerns over major escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and its impact on global oil prices. The World Bank has warned that such an escalation, potentially spilling over into a broader Middle East conflict, could cause oil prices to surge by as much as 75 percent. This situation has raised serious concern among economists and policymakers, who have been working to combat inflation.

The World Bank's study suggests that this crisis could compound existing energy market disruptions caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, creating a dual energy shock for the global economy. Global oil prices, currently around $85 per barrel, are projected to average $90 per barrel this quarter. The bank's projections for declining oil prices next year could drastically change if oil supplies are disrupted.

An escalation could, in the worst-case scenario, remove up to eight million barrels of oil per day from the market, driving prices up to $157 per barrel, similar to the 1973 Arab oil embargo (Rappeport). A less catastrophic but nonetheless disruptive scenario–the Iraq War in 2003– resulted in a five million barrel per day decrease in the supply of oil and a 35 percent increase in price, reaching $121 per barrel (Rappeport). Realistically, it would more closely resemble the Libyan crisis of 2011: two million barrels may be lost every day, pushing prices up to 13 percent to $102 per barrel (Rappeport).

The impact on inflation and the global economy would depend on the conflict's duration and how long oil prices remain elevated. Prolonged higher oil prices could lead to increased prices for food, industrial metals, and gold. While efforts have been made to prevent a spike in global oil prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the economic consequences of the current conflict are still uncertain. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen noted that the situation could have more significant consequences if the war were to expand, underlining the ongoing uncertainty regarding oil prices and their potential global economic ramifications.
