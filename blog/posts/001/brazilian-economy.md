# Brazil is consolidating a growth agenda



*By Marcio Santetti*



The chief topic in Lula da Silva's 2022 presidential campaign was to recover economic activity and, consequently, economic growth to the Brazilian economy. Nine months after taking office, data on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), calculated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics' (IBGE) Quarterly National Accounts System, revealed that the economy grew 0.9% between April and June, relative to the previous quarter. This is the eighth consecutive three-month period with positive growth numbers.



Leading Brazil for the third time after two successful periods in the early 2000s, Lula da Silva has always been clear about the importance of aggregate demand for overall economic performance. In his words, this presidential mandate would "put the poor back in the government  budget." It comes as no surprise that household spending (i.e., consumption) has reached its highest growth since the same quarter in 2022. Such a result may be boiled down to a more active labor market, better access to credit, and the improved "Bolsa Familia," an income transfer program that benefits more than 21 million families in the entire national territory.



Regarding its productive sectors, manufacturing and services showed positive results. The first grew 0.9%, while the second, 0.6%, all relative to this year's first quarter. In the manufacturing sector, the leading activities were mining and construction, while financial, law, and accounting services showed the best results within services. A somewhat surprising negative result came from the agribusiness sector, which slowed 0.9% this last quarter. However, between January and March, it grew 21%. This mostly comes from the fact that more than half of the year's soy production&mdash;a leading product for Brazilian exports&mdash;is concentrated in each year's first quarter. 



While results suggest major improvements and renewed confidence in the newly elected government, Brazil faces many economic challenges in the upcoming months. A crucial one regards its high interest rates, which directly influence business investment and household credit. Brazil's federal funds rate, known as "Selic," is at 13.3%, as of the beginning of September/2023. Major debates have been publicized between the Presidential Office and the independent Central Bank's president, who do not appear to be in tune regarding monetary policy. The next months reserve several discussions on this issue.
