# Sharp U.S. Hiring Slowdown Signals Cooling Economy Ahead



*By Arjun B K & Stacy Chen*



The U.S. economy is showing signs of cooling as growth in the job market sharply slowed last month. In October, employers added 150,000 jobs which is half of the previous month's gain and the smallest increase since June. This has led to a rise in the unemployment rate to 3.9% which is up half a point since April—and there is a deceleration in wage growth. If this hiring pullback continues, it may prompt the Federal Reserve to pause its historic interest-rate increases, signaling that higher borrowing costs are impacting the economy.

Despite the slowdown in the job market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant 5% rise for the week, marking its best one-week gain in a year.

The downward shift in the labor market is due to factors such as high-interest rates making it more expensive to borrow, persistent increases in price levels (inflation), and the ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. With this, job creation is uneven across various sectors. Notably, job gains were concentrated in just three sectors—healthcare, government, and leisure and hospitality—leaving the rest of the economy with no net job growth.

Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic suggests that October could be a turning point for the economy, predicting a recession in the first half of the next year. Other economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal view the chances of recessions as 50-50 chance. In addition, the continuous strikes are also impacting the job numbers. In particular, the United Auto Workers strike reduced jobs with automakers experiencing 33,000 fewer workers. Similarly, the transportation and warehousing industries lost 12,000 jobs, and the information industries, including striking film and television actors, lost 9,000. Furthermore, job gains from August and September were revised down by 101,000. In regards to wages, there has been slow growth. The average hourly earnings rose by 4.1% from a year ago which is a decrease from a 4.3% increase in September. The wage gains have been slowing since March 2022 when annual raises were near 6%.
