# Rising Interest Rates and Falling Inflation in Eurozone and US 



*By Theo Taylor & Ben Penfold*



Two recent Financial Times articles highlighted inflation and rising interest rates in the eurozone as well as the US. For over a year now, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have been steadily increasing interest rates to combat inflation. Their efforts have shown success in lowering inflation, but progress has not been without bumps along the way. 

 

Eurozone inflation peaked at 10.6 percent in 2022, and European interest rates have been raised to help lower that inflation rate. The inflation rate was down to 5.3 percent in August and is expected to drop to 4.6 percent by the end of September, which would be the lowest in almost 2 years. Despite this, the ECB has continued to increase its deposit rate–the interest banks receive from depositing with the ECB. The ECB recently made the decision to increase its deposit rate for the tenth consecutive time, quickly raising the deposit rate to a record high of 4 percent. This record increase, going from -0.5 percent last year, is an attempt by the ECB at getting back to a target inflation rate of 2 percent. There is some optimism that this most recent rate increase will be the ECB’s last, as the economy slows due to higher borrowing rates. Rising oil prices are a cause of concern for the disinflation process, but the ECB is most concerned with core inflation, which excludes energy and food.  

 

US Treasury yields (the annual interest rate the US government pays on debt obligations) have similarly hit a 15-year high. After the Fed indicated it was not done fighting inflation last week, the 2 and 10 year Treasury yields both jumped. Recent signs of a resilient economy in the US have added to concern that the consumer price cooldown may not be consistent. In August, core inflation was down to its lowest annualized level in the past two years, yet still increased by 0.3 percent, more than expected.
