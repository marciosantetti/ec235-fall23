# Rising debt continues, who’s going to pay the bills?



*By Justin Shafritz & Garn Leangphibul*



As concerns over rising US government debt continue, a New York Times article by

Alan Rappeport has announced that U.S. national debt has now exceeded $33 trillion as of

September 18, 2023. Data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank (FRED) shows that earlier in

the Covid-19 pandemic (the second quarter of 2020), federal government spending rose to $8.8

trillion per quarter, a historic high that is double the expenditure of the second quarter of 2008,

during the global financial crisis. Returning to the latest data for the second quarter of 2023,

government expenditure has decreased to $6.3 trillion, but still above pre-pandemic levels.

Looking at federal government tax revenue, FRED data shows that for the same second quarter

of 2023, the government collected $2.8 trillion. Government spending and tax revenue compose

the fiscal balance and as the data shows, the government continues to spend more than it collects,

leading to debt.



The pending debt crisis was leading Capitol Hill in the direction of a shutdown. However,

a short-term deal that gave a budget for 45 days was reached. According to an article from NBC

news, the Senate had already passed provisions to keep funding aid to Ukraine and FEMA in the

event of a shutdown. A CNN article written by Betsy Klein and Tami Luhby outlines the impacts

of a shutdown. These impacts include: the closing of all US federal agencies or members of

federal agencies such as TSA agents and the U.S. military working unpaid or being furloughed

until the end of the shutdown, and the SNAP benefits program would also lose funding, denying

low-income Americans critical supplemental income to spend on food.



As these concerns continue to worsen, it seems that from a fiscal perspective, the

government has two options: reduce government spending or increase taxation. Rappeport’s

article has highlighted that those who are typically Democrats tend to be in favor of raising taxes

to support higher government spending while those who lean more Republican are usually in

favor of slashing taxes and cutting government spending, leading to a balanced budget where

spending and revenue are equal. Both will result in a decrease in income, which regardless of

political standing, poses worry for the macroeconomy because output is equal to income.
