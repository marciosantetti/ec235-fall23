# Instability in The Bond Market



*By Max Heberlein & Jon Bouvier*



After rising a full percentage point in less than three months, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen briefly above 5 percent for the first time since 2007, sending shock waves through financial markets, investors, and policymakers. Such yields, like that of the 10-year Treasury note, determine interest rates that people pay on their debt, like credit cards, car loans, and mortgages. A strong, resilient U.S. economy has not reacted negatively to spikes in the interest rate as the Fed tries to cool down inflation, leading bond prices to go down, and yields to go up.

When the Fed began fighting inflation, only short-term market rates increased. These short- term rates moved closely with the Fed’s overnight lending rate, which jumped from nearly 0% to over 5% in under 2 years. Long-term rates remained mostly unaffected by the Fed’s intervention due to factors related to the long-term future of the economy. Strong economic resiliency has been an unforeseen outcome of the Fed’s rate-raising campaign. The rate-raising campaign intended to slow economic growth, but jobs and consumer spending data are proving to be more resilient than expected, meaning price gains have not leveled off as quickly as both the Fed and investors initially hoped. Citigroup's economic surprise index measures the variation of forecasted economic data with the actual numbers over time. The index shows that economic activity has been stronger than expected, producing a surge in 2023 Q3 GDP. Forecasted growth has led to the rise in long-term market-based interest rates, including the 10-year yield.

As the Fed is expected to continue raising interest rates in the future, the value of bonds has decreased, and demand has shrunk. The ramifications of bond volatility reach well beyond the bond market. The U.S. continues to operate under a large and growing government deficit and is struggling to find lenders to cover its debt obligations. In return, the Treasury needs to offer higher interest rates to lenders to incentivize the purchase of bonds, further hurting the cost of borrowing. As a result, investment will slow down as companies worry about the rising costs of borrowing. Home buyers, car buyers, and many more are being squeezed out of the market. In some cases, stock prices have dipped, coinciding with the rise in yields. Relatively minor shifts in the money market may correspond to significant effects in the goods market in the coming months.
