# Navigating Uncertain Market Conditions



*By Devin Herbinger & Danny Schnitzer*



In the past two years, the Federal Reserve has enacted quantitative tightening (QT)—contractionary measures—to control inflation. Historically, tightening monetary policy, characterized by high interest rates, poses challenges in financial markets. With the Federal Reserve in its second year of raising interest rates, this bears a problem for the stock market about how to balance investor sentiment with prevailing market conditions. From month to month, stock market investors continue to ask when the Fed will be done, and when interest rates will start to decline.

Despite inflation remaining at 3.7%, the consensus in the futures market suggests no further rate increases in the imminent future. The current target for inflation proposed by the Fed remains at 2%. The consensus is noteworthy as it reflects a prevailing belief among market participants that the Fed might perceive the current interest rate levels as adequate in addressing inflationary pressure. Though, this expectation does not diminish the uncertainties among short term traders regarding the Fed’s future actions. Equilibrium is tenuous with speculation that a decrease in interest rates will only materialize next year.

Something unusual is occurring in the current interest rate environment. Currently, short-term rates for 3-month treasuries are higher than long term rates for 10-year treasuries. This signals something called an “inverted yield curve,” which starts to indicate a recession in the near future. The yield curve has been inverted since November of last year, breaking the previous streak back in May of 2007, just about half a year before the great recession.

Although the unemployment rate remains low and GDP has been growing steadily, gross domestic income (GDI) has been on an opposite trend of GDP. This raises concern, because in a perfect economy, GDP and GDI should act in unison. As GDP tracks sales, GDI tracks paychecks, so for them to be far apart is unusual. To fix this, the GDI is being reworked by the Fed to include net interest payments made to banks and money market funds. What these interest payments are on include upwards of $4 trillion in bank reserves. Including these payments could work to cut the GDP-GDI gap in half.

Even though it is impossible to know what exactly will happen in the future, until the central interest rates are settled, the stock market may continue to fluctuate.
