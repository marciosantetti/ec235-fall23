# United Nations Economic Situation and Prospects 



*By Ethan Slager & Leo Kachanovsky*



During the first three quarters of 2023, labor markets in developed  economies have shown signs of returning to pre-pandemic conditions,  marked by a quick employment rebound similar to the period after the  2008–2009 financial crisis. Many developed economies, with the notable  exception of the United Kingdom, saw declining unemployment rates and  strong job growth. Nonetheless, labor shortages have still been a  persistent issue in certain occupations, and economic activity has  varied across major economies, with the United States showing steady  growth, while Germany, the eurozone, and the United Kingdom face weaker  growth. 

Despite sluggish economic activity in European countries, they have managed to maintain historically low levels of unemployment  rates. Even Greece, Italy and Spain, where double-digit unemployment has been a persistent feature of the economy for decades, saw significant  improvements not observed for a long period of time. There are several  key factors that have contributed to this. These improvements resulted  from economic recoveries post the 2008–2012 European debt crisis, more  stable banking systems, increased foreign investments, and a recent  resurgence in the tourism industry. Additionally, Spain implemented  labor reforms in February 2023, creating stricter conditions for hiring  temporary workers. 

In 2023, there also were increased living  costs due to a decrease in real wage and disposable income, despite  mitigating factors such as subsidies and transfers. Labor strikes in  industries such as automotive and film show worker dissatisfaction. That being said, an increased labor supply has decreased bargaining power of worker strikes. Gender gaps in the labor market continue to be present  while youth unemployment remains an issue. An increase in women leaving  the labor force due to the pandemic caused increased gaps in labor by  gender, but the gap has shrunk post pandemic. Women experienced a higher growth in employment than men, but the barrier of entry is still higher for women.  

Policy challenges prevent alleviation of the cost of living crisis and support of real wage growth. Efforts to prevent the  disproportionate increase in corporate profit at expense of labor  outcome has continued. Efforts to make equitable real wage distribution  are also continuing. Lowering NEET (Not in education, employment, or  training) rates to decrease youth unemployment is a critical challenge.
