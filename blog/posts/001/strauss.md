# Inflation During the Holiday Season



*By Jack Strauss*



As the holiday season opens, retailers are beginning their quest to lure shoppers in with lower deals. Retailers are planning on steeper mark-downs this year to attract customers who are weary of high inflationary prices. The number of shoppers this year between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday is expected to increase to 182 million people, according to the National Retail Federation. This is 16 million more people than last year.

 Due to inflation, the average outlay is expected to be 13% higher than last year, set at $567 per person in an estimate from Deloitte. In a study conducted by McKinsey, almost 80% of consumers are looking to “trade down” during holiday shopping this year. Meaning consumers are changing their planned purchases to cheaper alternatives, or just forgoing them altogether. Many consumers are adjusting their budgets for the holiday season, spending much less this year than they have in previous years. Reasoning for this comes from a rise in their budget for other spending necessities such as food and gas. 

Consumers’ recognition of inflationary prices means they only have so much to spend on certain things throughout their overall budget. When the holiday season comes around the corner, they just don’t have as much excess spending money to spend on gifts as they have had in the past. This has resulted in retailers offering much steeper discounts. In a study done by Adobe Analytics, average peak discounts for online apparel are up from 19% to 25% for this year’s holiday season. Another way retailers are attracting customers is through their own private label brands, which are commonly less expensive than name brand products. 

A way for consumers to ease their exposure to high inflationary payments is through buy now, pay later options. This option allows for short-term financing so consumers can break up their payments over time. Although it seems that retail products are becoming more expensive, retailers are doing their best to work with consumers to help them afford all their gifts this holiday season.
