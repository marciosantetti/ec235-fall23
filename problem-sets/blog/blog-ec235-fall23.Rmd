This Fall, the two sections of EC 235 will maintain a .b[blog] on *macroeconomic* issues/news/events.

The purpose of this recurring assignment is to make us "*look outside the window*." In other words, we should apply our learning of macroeconomics to real-world events, and a great way to apply this is by developing our *critical writing*.

The blog will function as follows:

- Students must work in .b[pairs];

- Every week, starting on week 2, the blog will have two weekly posts:

  - Section `001` will post on .hi[Wednesdays];
  
  - Section `002` will post on .hi[Fridays].
  
- Posts will consist of a *short text* (min. 300, max. 400 words), and students can write about *any* subject, *any* country (or group of countries), as long as it is related to .b[macroeconomic policies/events/problems/etc].

- Each 235 Section will assign .b[2] (two) students as *Associate editors*, who will be responsible for .b[reviewing] and .b[submitting] every text for the blog.

- Basically, the Associate editors will:

  - Organize the schedule with the classroom;
  
  - Check for the word count requirements and spelling;
  
  - Check whether the text is an original piece or copied from somewhere(one) else;
  
  - Submit each week's post to the instructor by email: `msantetti@skidmore.edu`
  
      - Section 001: every *Tuesday*, by **11:59 PM**.
    
      - Section 002: every *Thursday*, by **11:59 PM**.

- Associate editors are .hi[not] required to write blog posts, but they may participate/help in every post.

<br>


- The best source of inspiration is keeping up with the news (here are just some suggestions, but make sure to read .hi[reliable] sources):

  - [`The New York Times`](https://www.nytimes.com/section/business/economy);<sup>1</sup>.footnote[<sup>1</sup> Skidmore students can create a free account for the NYT website. More details [`here`](https://libanswers.skidmore.edu/faq/329674).]
  - [`Financial Times`](https://www.ft.com/);
  - [`The Economist`](https://www.economist.com/);
  - [`Washington Post`](https://www.washingtonpost.com/);
  - [`The Wall Street Journal`](https://www.wsj.com/);
  - [`VoxEU`](https://cepr.org/voxeu).


<br>



Finally, after writing your text, make sure to include your references at the bottom of the page. The way you should cite them is as follows:

> Author's Last Name, First Name. "Title of Article: Subtitle if Any." Title of Website, Date of Publication, URL. Accessed Day Month Year site was visited.

For example, if I used [`this online news article`](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/business/energy-environment/electric-vehicle-chargers-plugs-tesla.html) as one of my sources, I would cite it as:

- Ewing, Jack. "Electric Vehicle Charging Can Be Confusing. Hereâ€™s What to Know." The New York Times, Aug. 28, 2023, `https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/business/energy-environment/electric-vehicle-chargers-plugs-tesla.html`. Accessed Sep. 1, 2023.

<br>

The instructor will be in close contact with the *Associate editors*, and feel free to .b[ask any questions to all of us].
